My name is Guojing Tian, and in Chinese it is 田国敬. 

I am an assistant professor at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My education background is as follows.

- 2011.9-2017.6&emsp;&emsp;**Doctor's Degree**&emsp;&emsp;Information Security&emsp;&emsp;Prof. Qiaoyan Wen

  &emsp;&emsp;Institute of Network Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (**BUPT**)

- 2014.6-2015.7&emsp;&emsp;**Joint-PhD**&emsp;&emsp;Quantum Information Theory&emsp;&emsp;Prof. ChooHiap Oh

  &emsp;&emsp;Center for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore (**NUS**)

- 2007.9-2011.6&emsp;&emsp;**Bachelor's Degree**&emsp;&emsp;Information and Computing Sciences

  &emsp;&emsp;School of Mathematics and Statistics, Ludong University

I have always been focusing on the development of  quantum information theory, especially for the local discrimination of quantum states, from the beginning of my postgraduate stage. And most research progress I have made in this area has been included in my PhD thesis《最大纠缠态的局域区分性研究》. Since I joint our present Algorithms & Complexity Group in July, 2017, I have spent more attention to quantum computation and quantum algorithms. Or even how the quantum correlation changed in a specific quantum algorithm also interests me a lot. Overall, my research directions include

- Quantum Nonlocality
- Local Discrimination of Quantum States
- Local Equivalence for Sets of Quantum states 
- Quantum Correlations
- Quantum Algorithms and Realization
- Classical Simulation of Quantum Algorithms
- Optimization of Quantum Circuits
